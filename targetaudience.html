    <h3 style="font-family: Mangiola";> The target Audience</h3>
   <p> Our target audience consists mostly of the junior high school students here at APEC Schools Marikina Heights. The students are basically the ones who answered our survey; they are grade 8â€“10 students. So basically we are going to focus on teenagers or junior high school students. However, everyone is welcome to view our vlog and enjoy it. In this generation, "fashion" is also significant to all of us. Fashion can help or enhance their personal fashion style. So we picked fashion to assist those who do not know how to be stylish or how to dress for themselves. This can also entertain them and get more ideas on what fashion styles fit them and what other combinations of clothes they can do.
